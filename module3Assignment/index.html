           <h2> Indian Paneer Special</h2>
            <p id= "para1">Paneer makhani (also called paneer butter masala) is a slightly sweet creamy dish of paneer, originating from the Indian 
                subcontinent, in which the gravy is prepared usually with butter (makhan), tomatoes, cashews or cream.
                Spices such as red chili powder and garam masala are also used to prepare this gravy.
                A survey found that paneer butter masala was one of the top five foods ordered in India.Makhan is the Hindi word for 'butter'.
                Makhani means 'buttery'. This dish originated in the 1950s when Punjabis at Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi invented the sauce 
                by mixing fresh butter into a tomato-based curry.This is a list of Indian dishes. Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of 
                regional cuisine native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly 
                from each other and use locally available ingredients such as: herbs, vegetables and fruits. The dishes are then served according to taste 
                in either mild, medium or hot. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices, like Hinduism and traditions. 
                Some Indian dishes are common in more than one region of India, with many vegetarian and vegan dishes. Some ingredients commonly found 
                in Indian dishes include: rice, wheat, ginger, green chillies and spices.Shahi paneer is a preparation of paneer, native to the Indian subcontinent, 
                consisting of a thick gravy of cream, tomatoes and Indian spices.Originating with the creamy delicacies of Mughlai cuisine (hence the term "shahi", 
                in reference to the royal title of Shahanshah in Mughal India), this dish is prepared by emulsifying tomatoes, onions, ground cashews, clarified butter 
                and cream into a curry, with the addition of paneer cubes and a variety of spicesIt is mainly eaten with traditional Indian flat-breads like roti or naan, 
                rice and bread. Paneer is derived from the Persian word for cheese, and shahi is the term for royal (in reference to the Imperial Court of the Mughal Empire).
                Similar dishes include paneer butter masala and kadai paneer. The subtle difference between paneer butter masala and shahi paneer is that more of whole spices 
                are used in paneer butter masala, whereas shahi paneer has a sweeter taste when compared to paneer butter masala.Mughlai cuisine consists of dishes developed 
                in the medieval Indo-Persian cultural centres of the Mughal Empire. It represents a combination of cuisine of the Indian subcontinent with the 
                cooking styles and recipes of Central Asian and Iranian cuisine. Mughlai cuisine is strongly influenced by the Turko-Persian cuisine of Central Asia,
                the region where the early Mughal emperors originally hailed from, and it has in turn strongly influenced the regional cuisines of modern 
                Afghanistan, Northern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.The tastes of Mughlai cuisine vary from extremely mild to spicy, and are often associated with
                a distinctive aroma and the taste of ground and whole spices.[1] A Mughlai course is an elaborate buffet of main course dishes with a variety 
                of accompaniments.[2]Although the ruling class and administrative elite of the Mughal Empire could variously identify themselves as Turani (Turkic), 
                Irani (Persian), Shaikhzada (Indian Muslim) and Hindu Rajput, the empire itself was Indo-Persian, having a hybridized, pluralistic Persianate culture. 
                Decorated Indo-Persian cookbooks and culinary manuscripts adorned the personal libraries of the Mughal elite, serving as both culinary guides 
                and for aesthetic value. One example was the Ni'matnama, a 15th-century work illustrated with Persian miniatures. This was commissioned by Sultan Ghiyas Shah, 
                a sultan of Malwa in modern-day Madhya Pradesh, and features Central Asian dishes such as samosas (fried meat-filled pastry), 
                khichri (rice and lentils), pilaf (rice-dish), sikh (skewered meat and fish), kabab (skewered, roasted meat) and yakhni (meat broth), as well 
                as western and southern Indian dishes, such as karhi (yogurt broth mixed with chickpea flour), piccha and khandawi.From the Mughal
                period itself, one popular culinary work was the Nuskha-i-Shahjahani, a record of the dishes believed to be prepared for the court of
                Emperor Shahjahan (r.1627-1658). This Persian manuscript features ten chapters, on nānhā (breads), āsh-hā (pottages), qalīyas and dopiyāzas 
                (dressed meat dishes), bhartas, zerbiryāns (a kind of layered rice-based dish), pulāʾo, kabābs, harīsas (savoury porridge), shishrangas and 
                ḵẖāgīnas (omelette), and khichṛī; the final chapter involves murabbā (jams), achār (pickles), pūrī (fried bread), shīrīnī (sweets), ḥalwā (warm pudding), 
                and basic recipes for the preparation of yoghurt, panīr (Indian curd cheese) and the coloring of butter and dough
               Another famous textbook was Ḵẖulāṣat-i Mākūlāt u Mashrūbāt, perhaps dating to the era of the emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1656-1707),
                while another was Alwān-i Niʿmat, a work dedicated solely to sweetmeats. Divya Narayanan writes:
              These include varieties of sweet breads such as nān ḵẖatā̤ʾī (crisp bread, like a biscuit), sweet pūrīs, sweet samosas (or saṃbosas), 
              laḍḍū and ḥalwā. The cookbook introduces each recipe with a line of praise: for instance saṃbosa-i yak tuhī dam dāda 
              (samosa with a pocket cooked on dam) is declared as being ‘among the famous and well-known sweets; pūrī dam dāda bādāmī (almond pūrīs cooked on dam) is said to be 
              ‘among the delicious and excellent sweetmeats, and nān ḵẖatā̤ʾī bādāmī (almond nān ḵẖatā̤ʾī) is noted for being ‘among the rare and delicious recipes
              There are even many commonalities between Indo-Persian cookbooks used at the Mughal court and contemporary culinary works from Safavid Iran, such as the 
              Kārnāma dar bāb-i T̤abāḵẖī wa ṣanʿat-i ān (Manual on Dishes and their Preparation) of Ḥājī Muḥammad ʿAlī Bāwarchī Bag̱ẖdādī.
               Mughlai cuisine is renowned for the richness and aromaticity of the meals due to extensive use of spices like saffron, cardamom, black pepper, dry fruits and nuts,
              as well as rich cream, milk and butter in preparation of curry bases. This has influenced the development of North Indian cuisine.Korma is a dish originating in the Indian subcontinent, 
              consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt (dahi) or cream, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or glaze.[2]The English name is an anglicisation of Urdu qormā, meaning "braise".
              It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish. All these words, and the names of dishes such as ghormeh  and the Azerbaijani qovurma or kavarma, are ultimately derived from 
              a Turkish language word qawirma, meaning " fried thing".The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes 
              using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine[ of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, 
              said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.
               korma can make use of a technique called bagar: later in the cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising; the pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.
               There is a wide variation between individual korma and other "curry" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. 
              Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring.
              A korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.[8]In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. 
              It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st-century chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, 
              replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts – or sometimes both.[11] Navratan means "nine gems", and it is common for 
              the recipe to include nine different vegetables.
               Eid kormaIn some parts of South Asia, korma is used to denote a traditional Eid al-adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. 
              he flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef.
